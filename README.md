# FixFlowERP

> Computer Repair Shop Enterprise Resource Planning System

FixFlowERP is an Enterprise Resource Planning (ERP) system designed for computer repair shops. It provides a centralized platform for managing customers, devices, repair services, employees, inventory, invoices, payments, and other business operations.

This project is being developed as an academic project for the **Bachelor of Science in Information Technology** program.

---

## 📌 Overview

Computer repair shops often manage customers, repair requests, technicians, spare parts, inventory, payments, and employees using separate processes or manual records.

FixFlowERP aims to provide a centralized system that connects these operations into one platform.

The system follows a **multi-project architecture** and is designed to support **multiple companies and branches** through a Master Database and Tenant Database structure.

---

## 🎯 Objectives

The main objectives of FixFlowERP are to:

- Centralize computer repair shop operations
- Manage customers and their devices
- Manage service requests and repair jobs
- Manage employees, users, roles, and departments
- Track repair parts and inventory
- Manage stock-in and stock-out transactions
- Manage suppliers and purchasing
- Generate invoices
- Record customer payments
- Provide business reports
- Support multiple companies
- Support multiple branches
- Implement role-based access to system modules
- Maintain separation between company data and platform-level data

# 🏗️ System Architecture

FixFlowERP uses a multi-project and multi-tenant architecture.

```

# 🗄️ Database Architecture

FixFlowERP separates platform-level information from company operational information.

## Master Database

The Master Database stores information required to manage the overall ERP platform.

### Main Master Database Entities

- Companies
- Company Databases
- Modules
- Company Modules
- Subscriptions
- Platform Users

The Master Database is responsible for identifying companies, their database information, available modules, and subscription information.

---

## Tenant Database

Each company has its own Tenant Database containing its operational data.

### Main Tenant Database Entities

- Branches
- Departments
- Employees
- Users
- Roles
- Customers
- Devices
- Service Requests
- Repairs
- Repair Items
- Inventory Items
- Inventory
- Invoices
- Payments
- Suppliers
- Stock In
- Stock Out

The Tenant Database is responsible for the day-to-day operations of a specific company.

# 🏢 Multi-Company Architecture

FixFlowERP is designed to support multiple companies.

```text
                    Master Database
                          │
             ┌────────────┼────────────┐
             │            │            │
          Company A    Company B    Company C
             │            │            │
          Tenant DB    Tenant DB    Tenant DB
             │            │            │
          Branches     Branches     Branches
          Employees    Employees    Employees
          Customers    Customers    Customers
          Repairs      Repairs      Repairs
          Inventory    Inventory    Inventory
```

Each company's operational data remains inside its own Tenant Database.

This provides logical separation between different companies.

---

# 🏢 Branch Structure

Branches are stored inside the Tenant Database because branches belong to a specific company.

```text
Company
   │
   ├── Branch 1
   │     ├── Employees
   │     ├── Customers
   │     ├── Repairs
   │     └── Inventory
   │
   ├── Branch 2
   │     ├── Employees
   │     ├── Customers
   │     ├── Repairs
   │     └── Inventory
   │
   └── Branch 3
         ├── Employees
         ├── Customers
         ├── Repairs
         └── Inventory
```

---

# 🔐 Authentication & Authorization

The system separates platform-level authentication from company-level users.

## Master Users

Master users are responsible for platform-level administration.

Examples:

- Super Administrator
- Platform Administrator

These users belong to the Master Database.

## Tenant Users

Tenant users are employees of a company and belong to the Tenant Database.

Examples:

- Administrator
- Technician
- Receptionist
- Cashier
- Finance Staff
- HR Staff
- Inventory Staff

Tenant users are assigned roles that determine which parts of the system they can access.

## Stock In

Stock In represents inventory entering the company or branch.

Examples:

- Supplier purchases
- Received stock
- Returned items
- Inventory adjustments

```text
Stock In
   │
   └── Stock In Items
          │
          └── Inventory Item
```

## Stock Out

Stock Out represents inventory leaving the company's stock.

Examples:

- Parts used for repairs
- Items sold
- Damaged items
- Lost items
- Inventory adjustments

```text
Stock Out
   │
   └── Stock Out Items
          │
          └── Inventory Item
```

---

# 🧱 Database Design Principles

The database is designed with the following principles:

- Avoid unnecessary data duplication
- Maintain referential integrity
- Use primary keys and foreign keys
- Use appropriate relationship constraints
- Preserve historical transaction values
- Separate master data from transaction data
- Separate platform data from company data
- Support multiple branches
- Support role-based access

---

# 🚀 Getting Started

## Prerequisites

Before running the project, install:

- .NET SDK
- Microsoft SQL Server
- Visual Studio or Visual Studio Code
- Git

---

## 1. Clone the Repository

```bash
git clone <repository-url>
cd ComputerRepairSystem
```

---

## 2. Restore Dependencies

```bash
dotnet restore
```

---

## 3. Build the Solution

```bash
dotnet build
```

---

## 4. Configure the Database

Configure the database connection strings locally.

Example:

```json
{
  "ConnectionStrings": {
    "MasterErp": "",
    "TenantErp": ""
  }
}
```

Do not commit real database passwords, API keys, or other secrets to Git.

---

## 5. Apply Entity Framework Core Migrations

Apply the migrations for the appropriate DbContext.

For example:

```bash
dotnet ef database update
```

If multiple DbContexts are present, specify the appropriate context:

```bash
dotnet ef database update --context MasterErpDbContext
```

or:

```bash
dotnet ef database update --context TenantDbContext
```

---

## 6. Run the API

```bash
dotnet run --project ComputerRepairSystem.api
```

---

## 7. Run the Windows Forms Application

Run:

```text
ComputerRepairSystem.winforms
```

from Visual Studio.

---

# 🔧 Development Workflow

A typical development workflow is:

```text
Create / Modify Entity
        │
        ▼
Configure EF Core Relationship
        │
        ▼
Create Migration
        │
        ▼
Update Database
        │
        ▼
Create API / Service Logic
        │
        ▼
Create UI
        │
        ▼
Test
        │
        ▼
Commit Changes
```

---

# 🌿 Git Workflow

The project uses Git for version control.

## Recommended Branch Structure

```text
main
 │
 ├── develop
 │
 ├── feature/customer-management
 │
 ├── feature/repair-management
 │
 ├── feature/inventory-management
 │
 └── feature/payment-management
```

## Create a Feature Branch

```bash
git checkout -b feature/customer-management
```

## Commit Changes

```bash
git add .
git commit -m "Add customer management"
```

## Push the Branch

```bash
git push origin feature/customer-management
```

---

# 🔑 GitHub SSH Setup

The repository uses **SSH authentication** for GitHub instead of HTTPS.

The SSH remote should look like:

```text
git@github.com:USERNAME/ComputerRepairSystem.git
```

Check the current remote:

```bash
git remote -v
```

If the repository is still using HTTPS, change it to SSH:

```bash
git remote set-url origin git@github.com:USERNAME/ComputerRepairSystem.git
```

Verify the remote:

```bash
git remote -v
```

Test the GitHub SSH connection:

```bash
ssh -T git@github.com
```

After SSH authentication is configured, Git operations such as pushing and pulling can be performed without entering a GitHub username and password each time.

---

# 🔒 Configuration & Secrets

Sensitive configuration files should not be committed to Git.

Examples of files that should normally remain local:

```text
appsettings.json
appsettings.Development.json
.env
```

A template configuration file can be provided:

```text
appsettings.example.json
```
